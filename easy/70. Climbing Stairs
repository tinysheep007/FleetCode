70. Climbing Stairs

what you should do

- first draw a decision tree or any tree resembling the problem
- find the patterns
- you will realize the number of ways at n = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2) because you can only reach n from those spots
- We donâ€™t have to use a array to hold the Fibonacci sequence, we can simply use 3 variables and swap them multiple times
- watch out for base cases, we can start at 0 steps which has only 1 way to be there

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int one = 1;
        int two = 1;
        int temp = 1;
        int check = 1;
        
        //We loop n-1 times because our one and two techinically started at step 0 and step 1
        while(check <= n-1){
            temp = one;
            one = one + two;
            two = temp;
            check++;
        }

        return one;
    }
}
